# ee-120-labs
Python virtual labs based on the Jupyter Notebook developed for <a href="https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Courses/EE120/">*EE 120: Signals and Systems*</a> at UC Berkeley. 

## About

In the spring 2019 semester, we created a set of five labs as a project to re-introduce a hands-on lab component to our entry-level upper-division course in Signals and Systems. Since then, we've created five more to form a set of 10, and fine-tuned them based on student feedback.

Our paper summarizing the work has been accepted to the *2020 International Conference on Higher Education Advances*, and a prepublication version is available online [here](https://dominiccarrano.github.io/files/SelfContainedJupyterNotebookLabs.pdf).

The versions here are without solutions. If you're an educator at another institution and would like to use these in your course, contact Babak Ayazifar (ayazifar@berkeley.edu) about acquiring solutions.
